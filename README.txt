Ethan Hsiao's personal website
Highlights my various interests in the field of computer science and AI, as well as my past projects and industry experience working at MIT Media Lab, Qualtrics, and BFA Industries. This project will hopefully help with recruiting, as it will consolidate all my experiences and be a convenient place for recruiters to see my skill set and past work in industry.
